Documentation
==============

Basic instructions on the usage of the library are presented below.

Supported INI File Structure
----------------------------

A configuration file consists of sections, each led by a `[section]` header,  followed by `name = value`  entries..

Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from keys and values. Values can be omitted, these will be stored as an empty string.

Configuration files may include comments, prefixed by `;`. Hash marks (`#` ) may no longer be used as comments and will throw a deprecation warning if used.

Usage
------------------------------------

First, take the following INI file as an example:

    [DEFAULT]
    ServerAliveInterval = 45
    Compression = yes
    CompressionLevel = 9
    ForwardX11 = yes

    [github.com]
    user = foo

    [topsecret.server.com]
    Port = 50022
    ForwardX11 = no
